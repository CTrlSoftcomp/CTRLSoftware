<member name="M:CtrlSoft.App.TimeZoneInformation.TimeZoneFunctionality.GetTimeZoneInformation(CtrlSoft.App.TimeZoneInformation.TimeZoneFunctionality.TimeZoneInformation@)">
 <summary>
 [Win32 API call]
 The GetTimeZoneInformation function retrieves the current time-zone parameters.
 These parameters control the translations between Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
 and local time.
 </summary>
 <param name="lpTimeZoneInformation">[out] Pointer to a TIME_ZONE_INFORMATION structure to receive the current time-zone parameters.</param>
 <returns>
 If the function succeeds, the return value is one of the following values.
 <list type="table">
 <listheader>
 <term>Return code/value</term>
 <description>Description</description>
 </listheader>
 <item>
 <term>TIME_ZONE_ID_UNKNOWN == 0</term>
 <description>
 The system cannot determine the current time zone. This error is also returned if you call the SetTimeZoneInformation function and supply the bias values but no transition dates.
 This value is returned if daylight saving time is not used in the current time zone, because there are no transition dates.
 </description>
 </item>
 <item>
 <term>TIME_ZONE_ID_STANDARD == 1</term>
 <description>
 The system is operating in the range covered by the StandardDate member of the TIME_ZONE_INFORMATION structure.
 </description>
 </item>
 <item>
 <term>TIME_ZONE_ID_DAYLIGHT == 2</term>
 <description>
 The system is operating in the range covered by the DaylightDate member of the TIME_ZONE_INFORMATION structure.
 </description>
 </item>
 </list>
 If the function fails, the return value is TIME_ZONE_ID_INVALID. To get extended error information, call GetLastError.

 <summary>
 A SystemTime structure that contains a date and local time when the transition from daylight saving time to standard time occurs on this operating system. If the time zone does not support daylight saving time or if the caller needs to disable daylight saving time, the wMonth member in the SystemTime structure must be zero. If this date is specified, the DaylightDate value in the TimeZoneInformation structure must also be specified. Otherwise, the system assumes the time zone data is invalid and no changes will be applied.
 <para>To select the correct day in the month, set the wYear member to zero, the wHour and wMinute members to the transition time, the wDayOfWeek member to the appropriate weekday, and the wDay member to indicate the occurence of the day of the week within the month (first through fifth).</para>
